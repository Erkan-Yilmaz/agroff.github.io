        Understanding PoSV
    </h1>

    <p>
        In its most basic form, we can think of PoSV simply as compounding interest. It was designed to offer 5-6%
        interest, compounding every time you mint (produce new coins). For a rough approximation of returns, we will calculate the returns
        for 5% interest compounded daily.
    </p>

    </p>

    <h2>
        Isn't it a bit more complicated than that?
    </h2>

    <p>
        It is of course. Since your interest compounds every time you mint, we first need to understand when, or how
        often, you mint.
    </p>

    <p>
        To determine when you'll mint next, PoSV creates something called "Coin Weight." To determine your chance of
        being the next person to mint new coins, we compare the total weight of all your coins to the total weight of
        all coins which are actively staking.
    </p>

    <p>
        The total weight of all active coins can be considered the total number of
        "lottery tickets," and your total weight is the number of tickets you have. Every minute a winner is chosen to
        mint. Those with the highest weight are more likely to win on any given draw. Once you win, the weight of the
        coins that minted get reset and you move back in the line.
    </p>

    <h2>
        So how is weight calculated?
    </h2>

    <p>
        The calculation of coin weight is the core of PoSV. Like traditional PoS, the weight is a product of total coins
        (stake) and the average age of those coins. In contrast to traditional PoS, which calculates weight as a linear
        product of age, PoSV uses an algorithm where new coins gain weight quickly, and old coins gain weight increasingly
        slowly. This is how PoSV offers a big incentive to be active.
    </p>

    <p>
        To see the PoSV algorithm in action, we can look at a graph of coin weight over age.
    </p>

    <select id="weightGraphAge">
        <option value="3">3 Day Coin Age</option>
        <option value="7">7 Day Coin Age</option>
        <option value="10">10 Day Coin Age</option>
        <option value="31">30 Day Coin Age</option>
        <option value="90">90 Day Coin Age</option>
        <option value="120">120 Day Coin Age</option>
        <option value="360">365 Day Coin Age</option>
    </select>

    </p>

    <p>
        For the first week, you can see that coin weight is a linear function of coin age. The older the coin, the less
        weight it earns as time goes on.
